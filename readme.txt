= Before asking for help =

* If this plugin works (which means it activates without problems), please post your help request on the original [Jetpack forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jetpack). Your chances of getting help will be much better. I'm not the developer of this plugin. See notes below.
* If, otherwise, this plugin does not work (which means it is not activating or it's breaking your bolg), please ask [here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jetpack-omnisearch), and I shall help you fix it ASAP.

= Using Omnisearch =

Using Omnisearch is remarkably easy. Just search!  
If you’re in your WordPress Admin Panel, you can use the search bar in the WordPress Admin Bar (top right, just beyond your User Menu), or go to Dashboard → Omnisearch and start from there.  
Please note that the Search field on the WordPress Admin Bar will only Omnisearch from the back-end of your site, as the front-end already has a search field there to perform a site search natively, and we didn’t want to change that for you.

= Notes = 

[Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) is a plugin that ships with many modules. Why install the whole package, if you're just interested in one module?!

This plugin is the exact [Omnisearch module](http://jetpack.me/support/omnisearch/) of the original Jetpack plugin, only without all the extra stuff.

The version number of this plugin will follow the version number of Jetpack. This way, it's easier for you to know which Jetpack version this module was extracted from.

Things you'd be happy to know:

* The module is almost untouched. (Some lines had to be removed and some had to be added, for the sole reason of making the module a stand-alone plugin).
* The module was carefully extracted from the package. That means there is no missing feature or some irrelevant code.
* The module does not require a connection to a WordPress.com account.

Note: Translations were not included, due to the fact that Jetpack uses one transaltion file for all the modules, which makes it really difficult to extract translations.
The good news is that the module can be translated easily.
